	2.  Boolean Algebra Calculator
To find the simplified expression for given minterms of the Boolean expression. It consists of Power supply, Micro Controller, Numeric keypad for input and LED Display for output. It uses the Quine McCluskey algorithm to find the simplified expressions. Keypad consists of 9 switches, of which 8 switches corresponding  to one minterm each and the 9th one is used as next button. The micro controller takes this as input and using the algorithm simplifies and outputs the simplified expression using the LED lights connected to the output. Then the LED light is switched off indicating that it is ready to take the next input so the system restarts.

	3. Pull Pin Security Alarm System
To prevent our goods getting pick pocketed, It consists of an LM380, resistors, capacitors and a speaker. The circuit has a pin which is fixed to the pocket and the other end is attached to the circuit, when the wallet is removed the circuit becomes active and the speaker creates sound. The main component of the circuit is an oscillator which generates a sine wave of definite frequency, The oscillator which is used is an RC phase shift oscillator which produces the sine wave of definite frequency. The frequency of the RC phase shift oscillator is determined by the three stages of resistance and capacitance. the circuit uses negative feedback so the Barkhausen criterion has to be met for the operation, RC circuit ideally gives a phase shift of 90 degrees, but practically gives 60 degrees phase shift so using three such circuits to get 180 degrees phase shift, and the amplifier produces 180 degrees phase shift so overall 360 degrees phase shift and the system works fine. When the circuit is activated the signal from the audio oscillator is fed to the mini loud speaker which then generates a beep sound of that specific audio frequency.

	4.  Electronic Letter Box 
To indicate the presence of a letter in a letter box, LED is used as an indication it will be on when the letter box is empty once it contains a letter the LED turns off. It contains LED to emit light inside the letter box, LDR to detect this light when there is no letter and  in the presence of letter this light is blocked and the output changes this is connected to LM741 opamp which outputs low signal when the letter is not present, and high signal when the letter is present. This signal is now passed onto CD4001 Quad NOR Gate IC, it takes the signal as input and outputs a low signal when letter is absent resulting in the LED turned on, when the letter is present it outputs a HIGH signal resulting in turning off the LED which implies that there is a letter in  the letter box.

	6. Auto Intensity control of Street lights 
To Control the Intensity of street light using Pulse width modulation, Peak hours of the area are calculated and the PWM is adjusted by microcontroller to increase or decrease the intensity of street lights. The peak hours can be calculated by considering parameters like traffic density, time, light intensity of the environment. It consists of Atmega8 micro controller, DS1307 IC, LDR, LED, LCD display. LDR is used to find the light intensity of the environment, it is analog in nature so converted to digital using ADC by connecting it to the ADC pin of the micro controller, RTC is used to find the current time it is the Real time Clock, LCD display is used for displaying time read using RTC, LED array is the number of high power LED's connected in series, It is connected to PWM pin of the micro controller. The LDR is placed in darkness as the street lights switches on only when there is no light on LDR, Now if the time is between 9 PM and 2 AM, then street light glows with full intensity, from 2 PM intensity of the light slowly starts decreasing and finally in early morning when the light intensity increases the LDR detects it and the street light glows with very less intensity.

	7. Automatic light Switch 
When someone enters a room the light is turned on and when they leave it is turned off. It saves power since many a times some forget to switch off the light, and using this the person need not worry about turning on and off the light. This circuit is designed to consume lesser power so that it can be used in household and public washrooms without worrying about the power bill. It consists of Reed Switch with Magnet, LM741 Op-Amp IC, CD4017 Decade Counter IC, 5V Relay Module, Lamp, BC558 PNP Transistor, resistors, Power supply. Reed Switch is used to detect the opening and closing the door, it is a magnetically operated switch, it contains a magnetic sensitive switch, which when subjected to a small magnetic force, will either close or open. The Reed Switch is fixed to the wall near the door while the magnet is fixed to the door. Initially the reed switch is in closed state as the door is closed, when the door is opened and closed, the switch will open and close, as a result the output of the Op-Amp goes HIGH and then goes LOW. This in turn will cause the counter to produce HIGH output this is connected to the relay so the light is turned ON. Now again when the door is opened and closed while leaving the room this action once again will cause the same action to the output of the Op-Amp but the Pin of CD4017 is connected to Reset Pin the output will become LOW  and hence the relay will be turned OFF.

	8. LED Cube circuit 
To create  pattern using LED's, timer and a counter, It consists of 555 Timer IC, 2 4017 counter IC's. IC 4017 is a CMOS decade counter IC with inbuilt counter come decoder circuit. In the circuit we drive the LED's using the clock pulses, the first counter comes to play for first nine pulses and each trio of LED's glow for each pulse, from 10th pulse onwards the second counter comes into play. The clock pulses are given using a 555 Timer. The cathode of each LED is connected to the anode of another and each trio of LEDs is connected in parallel to another such that the cathodes of upper LEDs are connected to each other, resulting in a 3 by 3 by 3 LED cube arrangement. Anodes of all the LEDs are connected together to the ground potential. When switch is closed 555 Timer produces the required clock pulses used to trigger the counters, Output pulse from the IC is fed to the two counter IC's in parallel arrangement, to give the clock pulses simultaneously. For each positive clock pulse received the counter output at the corresponding output pin will go high, Since each output pin is connected to each of the series arrangement of LEDs, every time one of the output pins is at logic high, the corresponding series of LEDs would glow. The first clock pulse when pin 3 of the counter IC goes high, the connected trio of LEDs start glowing. For the first 9 pulses, the each trio of LEDs glows. Thus this circuit displays a spectacular view of the LED cube wherein for each clock pulse, each trio of LEDs glow and since time period of clock pulses is quite low, and the cube appears to blink.

	9. Obstacle Avoiding Robot using Arduino 
A Robot which detects any unexpected obstacles around it and follows the path with greatest distance from obstacles. It consists of Arduino UNO, Ultrasonic Range finder sensor, Motor Driver, Servo Motor, Geared Motors, Robot Chassis, Power Supply. Using an external trigger signal, the Trig pin on ultrasonic sensor is made logic high for at least 10Âµs. A sonic burst from the transmitter module is sent. This consists of 8 pulses of 40KHz. The signals return back after hitting a surface and the receiver detects this signal. The Echo pin is high from the time of sending the signal and receiving it. This time can be converted to distance using appropriate calculations. When the robot is turned on both the motors will run normally, and the robot moves forward, the ultrasonic sensor continuously calculates the distance between the robot and the reflective surface. If the distance between the robot and the obstacle is less than 15 cm the robot stops and scans in left and right directions, whichever side has the largest distance calculated by the ultrasonic sensor the servo motor turns it to that side and the robot moves in that direction. First it backs up when an obstacle is found then creates room to turn, this process continues forever and the robot keeps on moving without hitting any obstacle. The Ultrasonic sensor should not be connected directly to power supply as it might affect the normal performance. Instead of ultrasonic sensor, an IR transmitter â receiver pair can also be used.

	10. TAPLOCK : Bike Lock System with Machine Learning 
To protect bikes from thieves using the power of machine learning. the platform used to implement machine learning is Edge Impulse, the components include Arduino Nano, Android device, power bank, 3D printing for fabrication. For tap detection we used the accelerometer that can be found on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense. By default, Edge impulse records the three separate axes for 5000 milliseconds and presents it as a graph of axial acceleration based on time.  Preprocessing the accelerometer output on the board by averaging the acceleration over all three axes - taps and vibrations caused by them don't really have a direction. We then took the time between two peaks as the time between taps and outputted it as four numbers for a five tap sequence(time in milliseconds between the first and second peak, second and third,â¦ This data is then imported into Edge Impulse, using the raw data processing block and Keras neural learning block. 

	11. Pulse Oximeter and Heart Rate Monitor
To display the blood oxygen level, and monitors the heart rate. This device is not reliable or accurate enough to be used as a medical diagnosis or reference, but provides a way to build the same. It consists of Arduino Nano, Breadboard, MAX30102 Sensor, I2C OLED Screen, LED's, resistors. Make sure to use 3.3 V output from the Arduino and not 5 V accidentally using the 5 V could damage screen or MAX30102 sensor.  Do not power the Arduino until the wiring is completed and double-checked, and do not leave the Arduino powered while fixing connections on the breadboard. Also, ensure that the LEDs are in the proper orientation: the longer leg (anode) of the LED is the positive side and should be connected to the Arduino pins and resistor, while the shorter side (cathode) should be connected to ground. It works when we place our finger on the sensor, Heart rate, SP02 is displayed on the screen, range of SP02 values is predetermined and green color is displayed if it is in good range else red color is displayed.

Connect the Arduino to computer via USB cable. Upload the code for conversion, using switch statement all the text is mapped to its analogous Morse code and given as output, and the output will display the Morse code in both visual and audio format. The code reads the string to an array and then using the GetChar function this converts each character into dots and dashes. It is displayed visually using LED's and audio from the mini speaker is the output Morse code.

	13. Live Wire Detector for Contactless AC Voltage Detection
Identifying a Live wire or distinguishing between line and neutral wires, a low cost AC voltage detector. There can be lot of injuries resulting from electrical shocks especially while maintaining and repairing electrical lines and towers. It is very difficult to isolate and check the presence of voltage in the wires without cutting it. A contactless voltage detector could come in very handy when dealing with such situations to be sure about no presence of voltage before performing any task related to reconditioning of electrical systems. It consists of 3 NPN transistors, resistors, battery, LED, Buzzer, Copper wire. The circuit is as follows :

The sensitivity of the module can be altered by increasing or decreasing the size of the antenna coil. The AC voltage detector module is powered by a 9V battery, which then is ready to detect any AC voltage. The module and the antenna are moved along the live wire and it can be seen that the LED glows and the buzzer starts to beep as shown in the image given below, where our circuit is placed near a live wire which is powering our RPS. The electromagnetic signal is detected by the antenna on the circuit board and it, therefore, indicates that it is a live wire and should be handled with care. 

	14. 555 Timer based Police Siren 

Produces the sound of a Police Siren using two 555 Timer IC's. IT consists of Breadboard, two  555 Timer IC's, Capacitors, resistors, Potentiometer, Battery. Connect the circuit using the above components on the breadboard as follows :
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85408861/121812734-ab816500-cc86-11eb-8d88-c90aed1df5ea.png)
		

Both the ICs are working in the astable mode which means they are generating a continuous sequence of pulses on their output. We know that pin 5 of the IC is the control pin and thus by connecting it to an input voltage, we can change the reference voltages of comparators and thus the final output of the IC. The output of the first IC is connected to pin 5 of the second IC which in result modulates the output of the second IC according to its output pulse. The output of this IC is connected to an 8-ohm speaker via a 47uf capacitor which creates a tone that resembles the sound exactly like a police siren. Note that you can also use a PNP transistor by connecting its emitter to pin 5 of IC 2 and collector to the ground. The switching of this transistor is depending on the first IC. We are doing this so that the control pin of the IC will get a stable voltage and thus give a stable reference voltage to the comparators. This will remove the fluctuations and the output siren tone will be much clear. Still, if your sound is not clear you can use a very small valued resistor (around 10-ohms) in series with the speaker.

	15. Magnetic Polarity Detector using Hall effect sensor 

To detect the North Pole and South Pole of a magnet, whether it is neodymium magnet, ring magnet or disc magnet. We also know that opposite poles of a magnet attract and same poles repel. But it is hard to say that which one is south pole and which one is a north pole, so to detect the poles of the magnet, here we will build a simple circuit. In this project, we are going to build a Magnetic Polarity Detector using the Hall Sensor and LEDs. Here two Hall Effect sensors are used to detect the North Pole and the South Pole, and these sensors are connected in the opposite direction. One sensor detects the North Pole and another Sensor detects the South Pole. Two LEDs are used to indicate the North Pole and the South Pole of a magnet. It consists of Hall effect sensor, LED, 7805 Voltage regulator, Capacitor, resistor. Hall Effect sensor is a small-scale microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device for detecting and measuring magnetic fields. These sensors can detect changes in a magnetic field like flux, strength, and direction. When the magnetic flux density around the sensor changes due to the magnet, the sensor detects it and generates an output voltage, and due to this output voltage LED connected to the Magnet sensor changes its state from low to high. In this project, we are using the Hall Effect sensors to detect the North Pole and the South Pole of a magnet. The circuit is as follows :

After connecting the circuit, as shown in the above image, power the setup using a 9V battery. Initially, LEDs will be in High state. Now bring a magnet closer to the Magnet sensors, if you bring south pole near to Red LED, it will turn off. And if you bring North pole near to Green LED indicates it becomes off.
